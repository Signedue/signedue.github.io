# Combined View: Crime, Income, and Education in Denmark

This page brings together our three separate analyses of **crime rates**, **income levels**, and **educational attainment** in Danish municipalities â€” to explore how these dimensions interact. Can we detect meaningful **patterns** when we compare them side by side? Do municipalities with high crime also face low education or income? Or are the relationships more complex?

Our goal is not to prove causality â€” but to spark curiosity and provide a more holistic view of regional disparities across Denmark.

## Top vs Bottom 5 Municipalities â€“ A Cross-Domain Comparison

We begin by zooming in on the **top 5** and **bottom 5** municipalities in each of the three domains: crime, education, and income.

### Crime Rates (2008â€“2024)

- **Top 5** (highest crime): Lolland, BrÃ¸ndby, Guldborgsund, IshÃ¸j, Odense  
- **Bottom 5** (lowest crime): ChristiansÃ¸, FanÃ¸, HÃ¸rsholm, Skanderborg, Odder

### Educational Attainment (2023)

- **Top 5** (most educated): Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, Odense, Vejle  
- **Bottom 5** (least educated): ChristiansÃ¸, LÃ¦sÃ¸, FanÃ¸, SamsÃ¸, Ã†rÃ¸



## Income Trends Summary (2007â€“2023)

### ðŸŸ¢ Top Regions (e.g., Gentofte, Rudersdal, HÃ¸rsholm)

- **Consistent Lead**: These municipalities have maintained a significantly higher level of combined disposable income over the entire period.
- **Steady Growth**: There's a clear upward trend, with noticeable spikes around 2015 and again between 2020 and 2023 â€” possibly linked to economic policy changes, demographic shifts, or pandemic-related impacts.
- **Gentofte** stands out with the highest income, exceeding **1.2 million DKK** by 2023.

### ðŸ”´ Bottom Regions (e.g., Lolland, LÃ¦sÃ¸, Bornholm)

- **Persistent Gap**: These regions consistently show lower combined income levels â€” less than half that of top performers.
- **Slower Growth**: Although there's overall growth, it's much less steep. Economic disparity appears stable or even widening over time.
- **Sudden Jumps**: Some regions like **Billund** (previously in the bottom tier) show a sharp increase in 2023 â€” worth investigating for potential local economic developments.

## ðŸ†š Deep Dive: Lolland vs Gentofte

Letâ€™s compare two symbolic opposites:

### **Lolland**
- Among the highest crime rates in Denmark.
- Among the lowest income municipalities.
- Not in the top ranks of education.

### **Gentofte**
- Among the highest income municipalities.
- High levels of educational attainment.
- Not in the top 5 for lowest crime, but far from high-crime areas.

This contrast helps frame a broader story: **structural advantage compounds across domains â€” and disadvantage can, too**.

## ðŸ’¡ Crime vs Education & Income: Hypotheses

From this comparison, we can generate several hypotheses for further exploration:

- Does low education correlate with higher crime?
- Does higher income consistently align with lower crime?
- Are gender differences in crime mirrored in income gaps?

While our dataset doesnâ€™t allow for strong causal conclusions, visualizing these overlaps gives a clearer sense of **where multidimensional disadvantage might be occurring** â€” and where **interventions** could be focused.

## âœ… Conclusion

This combined view shows that analyzing crime, income, and education in isolation **misses important connections**. When we bring them together:

- **Patterns of inequality become more visible**
- **Certain municipalities emerge as structurally challenged**
- **Others reveal resilience or surprising contradictions**

Understanding these interactions is crucial for policymakers, researchers, and citizens who aim to promote **balanced regional development** across Denmark.
