# Combined View: Crime, Income, and Education in Denmark

This page brings together our three separate analyses of **crime rates**, **income levels**, and **educational attainment** in Danish municipalities — to explore how these dimensions interact. Can we detect meaningful **patterns** when we compare them side by side? Do municipalities with high crime also face low education or income? Or are the relationships more complex?

Our goal is not to prove causality — but to spark curiosity and provide a more holistic view of regional disparities across Denmark.

## Top vs Bottom 5 Municipalities – A Cross-Domain Comparison

We begin by zooming in on the **top 5** and **bottom 5** municipalities in each of the three domains: crime, education, and income.

### Crime Rates (2008–2024)

- **Top 5** (highest crime): Lolland, Brøndby, Guldborgsund, Ishøj, Odense  
- **Bottom 5** (lowest crime): Christiansø, Fanø, Hørsholm, Skanderborg, Odder

### Educational Attainment (2023)

- **Top 5** (most educated): Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, Odense, Vejle  
- **Bottom 5** (least educated): Christiansø, Læsø, Fanø, Samsø, Ærø

### Income Levels (2023)

- **Top 5** (highest income): Gentofte, Rudersdal, Lyngby-Taarbæk, Hørsholm, Dragør  
- **Bottom 5** (lowest income): Langeland, Lolland, Bornholm, Ishøj, Guldborgsund

## Do the Patterns Overlap?

Now that we’ve seen each domain separately, let’s explore how they intersect.

- **Lolland** and **Guldborgsund** appear in both the **top 5 for crime** and **bottom 5 for income**, suggesting deeper structural challenges.
- **Ishøj** also shows up with **high crime and low income**, strengthening this association.
- **Odense** is among the **top 5 for crime** but also in the **top 5 for education**, indicating that educational progress may not be sufficient to reduce crime alone.
- **Christiansø** and **Fanø** appear in the **bottom 5 across crime and education**, but this may be due to their small population sizes — rather than systemic issues.

A key insight here is that **not all regions follow the same patterns**. High education doesn’t always guarantee low crime, and income alone doesn’t explain everything. But there are municipalities — like **Lolland, Ishøj, and Guldborgsund** — where **multiple disadvantages converge**.

## Deep Dive: Lolland vs Gentofte

Let’s compare two symbolic opposites:

### Lolland
- Among the **highest crime rates** in Denmark.
- Among the **lowest income** municipalities.
- Not in the top ranks of education.

### Gentofte
- Among the **highest income** municipalities.
- High levels of **educational attainment**.
- Not in the top 5 for lowest crime, but far from high-crime areas.

This contrast helps frame a broader story: **structural advantage compounds across domains** — and disadvantage can, too.

## Crime vs Education & Income: Hypotheses

From this comparison, we can generate hypotheses for further exploration:

- Do **low education levels** correlate with **higher crime**?
- Does **higher income** consistently align with **lower crime**?
- Are **gender differences** in crime mirrored in **income gaps**?

While our dataset doesn’t allow for strong causal conclusions, visualizing these overlaps gives a clearer sense of where **multidimensional disadvantage** might be occurring — and where interventions could be focused.

## Conclusion

This combined view shows that analyzing **crime**, **income**, and **education** in isolation misses important connections. When we bring them together:

- Patterns of inequality become more visible
- Certain municipalities emerge as structurally challenged
- Others reveal resilience or surprising contradictions
