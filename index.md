# Social Patterns in Denmark: Crime, Income & Education

This page brings together insights from our three thematic analyses — **crime**, **income**, and **education** — to explore how these dimensions interact across Danish municipalities. Using public data from Statistics Denmark, we investigate whether high crime correlates with low income or education, and where Denmark’s social inequalities are most visible.

## Connecting the Dots: A Multi-Dimensional View

While each topic is analyzed in depth on its own page, this section offers an integrated perspective.

We focus on municipalities that repeatedly appear at the **extremes**:
- High or low **crime rates**
- High or low **income**
- High or low **educational attainment**

Understanding these overlaps can help us answer broader questions:
- Do areas with **low income and education** also have **higher crime**?
- Are urban municipalities more equal or more divided?
- Which regions face **multiple social challenges**, and which are thriving?

## Revisited: Crime, Income & Education in Top/Bottom Regions

Let's look at five municipalities that show up consistently in our analyses:

### Lolland, Brøndby, Guldborgsund, Ishøj, Odense
These municipalities had **high crime rates**, and many also rank **low in income** and **education**.

<iframe src="Bottom 10 Least Educated Regions.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

These areas face **multiple disadvantages**, indicating a strong correlation between **social inequality and crime**. For example:
- **Lolland** consistently ranks low in income and education, and high in violent crime.
- **Odense** appears more mixed: high crime, but relatively higher income and education levels.

### Christiansø, Fanø, Hørsholm, Skanderborg, Odder
On the opposite end, these municipalities have **very low crime**, often paired with **higher income** and **better education** outcomes.

<iframe src="Top 10 Educated Regions.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

These places represent areas of **social advantage**. For instance:
- **Hørsholm** and **Skanderborg** perform strongly on all three dimensions.
- **Christiansø** has low crime but fewer educated residents due to its very small population size.

## Does Income Inequality Link to Crime?

We can also compare **gender-based income gaps** to crime rates.

<iframe src="/crime_gender_top.html" width="100%" height="450px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Both plots show persistent **gender inequality**:
- **Men earn more** and **commit more crimes** — even in high-income areas.
- Regions with wide **income gaps** may also face social tensions contributing to higher crime levels.

## Education & Crime: A Causal Relationship?

Education may play a **preventive role** in criminality:
- Higher education correlates with **lower crime**.
- Low education areas often face **higher volatility** in crime trends.

<iframe src="/crime_volatility_top_bottom.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

For example:
- Regions with **fast-growing education** tend to have **lower crime volatility**.
- **Fanø**, which has educational challenges, also has fluctuating crime patterns.

## Final Thoughts

By combining crime, income, and education data, we observe:

- A **clear connection** between social disadvantage and crime.
- Municipalities that struggle on one dimension often struggle on others.
- Education and income appear to be **protective factors** against criminality.
- Gender remains a major axis of inequality across all themes.

This multi-dimensional view helps move beyond isolated statistics toward a more **holistic understanding** of social inequality in Denmark — one that can inform both research and policy.
