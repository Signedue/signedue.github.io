# 🌍 Income Trends Across Denmark (2007–2023)
___
💰 **Income isn’t just a number — it’s a reflection of opportunity, stability, and inequality.**  
In Denmark, where the welfare model aims for equity, regional and gender-based income gaps still tell a deeper story.

On this page, we explore 17 years of income data (2007–2023) gathered from Statistics Denmark ([dst.dk/en](https://www.dst.dk/en)). The original dataset, labeled “Income Database,” was split into two subsets by gender — “Men” and “Women” — to allow for more focused analysis.This exploration aims to uncover:

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **How income trends vary between men and women**  
🗺️ **Which Danish regions are climbing — or falling — in terms of disposable income**  
📈 **Where economic growth is accelerating — and where it’s stagnating**

From metropolitan Copenhagen to rural Langeland, income data reveals how Denmark’s economic progress is being shared — or not — across its population.

With education and crime rate, we are interested in identifying any patterns in income across different areas in Denmark, particularly in Copenhagen. The charts above display trends in disposable income for men and women in the top five and bottom five regions from 2007 to 2023. For men, the data reveals that Gentofte, Rudersdal, Billund, Hørsholm, and Lyngby-Taarbæk consistently rank among the highest income regions. Notably, Gentofte exhibits the highest male disposable income, approaching 700,000 DKK in 2023, while Billund shows a dramatic increase between 2022 and 2023. Conversely, Langeland, Lolland, Albertslund, Bornholm, and Ærø remain among the lowest-income regions for men throughout the period, with only modest growth observed over time.

<div align="justify">
Similarly, among women, Gentofte, Vejen, Rudersdal, Lyngby-Taarbæk, and Hørsholm lead in disposable income. Gentofte again tops the list with a sharp rise to over 500,000 DKK in 2023, and Vejen also sees a notable spike that year. On the lower end, regions such as Langeland, Lolland, Ærø, Læsø, and Morsø exhibit significantly lower incomes, generally below 220,000 DKK until 2022, with only slight upward trends.
These income disparities can potentially be linked to regional differences in education levels, employment opportunities, and crime rates. Higher-income municipalities may have better educational institutions and lower crime, contributing to overall economic prosperity. In contrast, lower-income regions may face systemic challenges that inhibit income growth. Further correlation analysis with educational attainment and crime statistics will help clarify these patterns. These disparities likely reflect differences in education, job opportunities, and crime rates.

#### 🔍 Key Insights

- **Billund** tops the list with the most significant growth — men’s disposable income increased by more than 360,000 DKK, far exceeding other regions.
- **Gentofte** and **Rudersdal** follow in second and third place, with income growth of approximately 310,000 DKK** and 270,000 DKK, respectively.
- Regions such as Dragør, Lyngby-Taarbæk, and Hørsholm experienced moderate growth, ranging between 160,000 to 180,000 DKK.
- Frederiksberg, Furesø, Allerød, and Rebild had the lowest growth among the top 10, each registering increases around 140,000 to 150,000 DKK.

The dramatic lead by **Billund** may reflect localized economic developments — such as investments, industry presence, or demographic shifts — that disproportionately benefited men’s earnings. More modest growth in regions like Rebild and Allerød still indicates positive change but on a smaller scale. Overall, the chart suggests **growing economic disparities** between regions in terms of **male disposable income growth**.

The bar chart titled **"Top 10 Regions by % Income Growth (2007–2023)"** shows the percentage increase in disposable income over time, allowing for a normalized comparison across regions regardless of starting income levels. The X-axis lists the top-performing regions, while the Y-axis represents the percentage growth in disposable income from 2007 to 2023.

#### 🔍 Key Highlights

- **Billund** stands out dramatically, with a percentage growth exceeding 180%, far surpassing all other regions. This suggests an extraordinary economic development or income surge** over the period.
- **Gentofte** and **Rudersdal** follow with strong but significantly lower growth rates, around 80% and 75%, respectively.
- Regions such as Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Rebild, and Dragør all experienced fairly similar percentage increases, clustered between 68% and 72%.
- The lower end of the top 10 includes Lyngby-Taarbæk, Samsø, and Lemvig, each with growth rates just under 65%.
This percentage-based perspective emphasizes not just the absolute income gains but the relative improvement in disposable income for each region Billund again dominates, indicating it likely had both lower starting income levels and significant growth, making it an economic outlier in terms of development. The consistency in growth among the other regions suggests **widespread but uneven economic progress** across Denmark.
