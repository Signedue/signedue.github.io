# 🌍 Income Trends Across Denmark (2007–2023)
___
💰 **Income isn’t just a number — it’s a reflection of opportunity, stability, and inequality.**  
In Denmark, where the welfare model aims for equity, regional and gender-based income gaps still tell a deeper story.

On this page, we explore 17 years of income data (2007–2023) gathered from Statistics Denmark ([dst.dk/en](https://www.dst.dk/en)). The original dataset, labeled “Income Database,” was split into two subsets by gender — “Men” and “Women” — to allow for more focused analysis.This exploration aims to uncover:

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **How income trends vary between men and women**  
🗺️ **Which Danish regions are climbing — or falling — in terms of disposable income**  
📈 **Where economic growth is accelerating — and where it’s stagnating**

Income data reveals how Denmark’s economic progress is being shared—or not—across its population, from metropolitan Copenhagen to rural Langeland.

The charts highlight disposable income trends for men and women in Denmark’s top and bottom five regions from 2007 to 2023. For men, Gentofte consistently records the highest disposable income, reaching nearly 690,000 DKK in 2023, followed closely by Rudersdal and Hørsholm. Lyngby-Taarbæk and Dragør round out the top five with steady upward trends. The lowest-income regions—Langeland, Lolland, Bornholm, Ishøj, and Guldborgsund—remain under 260,000 DKK in 2023, despite gradual increases.

For women, Gentofte again leads, surpassing 500,000 DKK by 2023. Rudersdal, Hørsholm, Lyngby-Taarbæk, and Furesø also show robust growth, although at lower levels than their male counterparts. On the other end, Langeland, Lolland, Ærø, Læsø, and Morsø have persistently low incomes, just crossing 200,000 DKK in recent years.


<div align="justify">
A noticeable gender income gap exists across all regions, with men earning significantly more than women in both high- and low-income municipalities. The disparity is particularly stark in affluent areas like Gentofte and Rudersdal.

These patterns likely correlate with regional differences in education levels, crime rates, and employment opportunities. High-income regions may benefit from better schooling and lower crime, creating a more favorable economic environment. In contrast, persistent low income in some municipalities suggests structural disadvantages that limit economic mobility. These findings warrant deeper analysis using crime and education data to confirm such relationships and inform policy strategies for reducing inequality.

<div align="justify">
The combined disposable income trends from 2007 to 2023 reveal a clear and persistent economic divide between the top and bottom regions in Denmark. Municipalities such as Gentofte, Rudersdal, and Hørsholm consistently lead in combined income levels, reflecting a high concentration of wealth and economic opportunity. Gentofte, in particular, stands out with a dramatic increase, reaching over 1.2 million DKK by 2023. These top regions show steady and robust growth across the years, with notable surges around 2015 and again in the 2020–2023 period—potentially influenced by economic policy changes, urban development, or pandemic-related dynamics.


Interestingly, Billund, which has historically ranked among the lower-income regions, shows a sharp and unexpected rise in 2023, suggesting a potential shift in local economic activity or population dynamics that warrants further investigation. Overall, the data paints a picture of uneven economic development, where affluent municipalities continue to outpace their less prosperous counterparts, raising important questions about regional equity and long-term socioeconomic balance.

#### 🔍 Key Insights

- **Billund** tops the list with the most significant growth — men’s disposable income increased by more than 360,000 DKK, far exceeding other regions.
