#  Income Trends Across Denmark (2007–2023)
___
 **Income isn’t just a number — it’s a reflection of opportunity, stability, and inequality.**  
In Denmark, where the welfare model aims for equity, regional and gender-based income gaps still tell a deeper story.

On this page, we explore 17 years of income data (2007–2023) gathered from Statistics Denmark ([dst.dk/en](https://www.dst.dk/en)). The original dataset, labeled “Income Database,” was split into two subsets by gender — “Men” and “Women” — to allow for more focused analysis.This exploration aims to uncover:

 **How income trends vary between men and women**  
🗺 **Which Danish regions are climbing — or falling — in terms of disposable income**  
 **Where economic growth is accelerating — and where it’s stagnating**

Income data reveals how Denmark’s economic progress is being shared—or not—across its population, from metropolitan Copenhagen to rural Langeland.

The charts highlight disposable income trends for men and women in Denmark’s top and bottom five regions from 2007 to 2023. For men, Gentofte consistently records the highest disposable income, reaching nearly 690,000 DKK in 2023, followed closely by Rudersdal and Hørsholm. Lyngby-Taarbæk and Dragør round out the top five with steady upward trends. The lowest-income regions—Langeland, Lolland, Bornholm, Ishøj, and Guldborgsund—remain under 260,000 DKK in 2023, despite gradual increases.

For women, Gentofte again leads, surpassing 500,000 DKK by 2023. Rudersdal, Hørsholm, Lyngby-Taarbæk, and Furesø also show robust growth, although at lower levels than their male counterparts. On the other end, Langeland, Lolland, Ærø, Læsø, and Morsø have persistently low incomes, just crossing 200,000 DKK in recent years.


<div align="justify">
A noticeable gender income gap exists across all regions, with men earning significantly more than women in both high- and low-income municipalities. The disparity is particularly stark in affluent areas like Gentofte and Rudersdal.

These patterns likely correlate with regional differences in education levels, crime rates, and employment opportunities. High-income regions may benefit from better schooling and lower crime, creating a more favorable economic environment. In contrast, persistent low income in some municipalities suggests structural disadvantages that limit economic mobility. These findings warrant deeper analysis using crime and education data to confirm such relationships and inform policy strategies for reducing inequality.

<div align="justify">
The combined disposable income trends from 2007 to 2023 reveal a clear and persistent economic divide between the top and bottom regions in Denmark. Municipalities such as Gentofte, Rudersdal, and Hørsholm consistently lead in combined income levels, reflecting a high concentration of wealth and economic opportunity. Gentofte, in particular, stands out with a dramatic increase, reaching over 1.2 million DKK by 2023. These top regions show steady and robust growth across the years, with notable surges around 2015 and again in the 2020–2023 period—potentially influenced by economic policy changes, urban development, or pandemic-related dynamics.


Interestingly, Billund, which has historically ranked among the lower-income regions, shows a sharp and unexpected rise in 2023, suggesting a potential shift in local economic activity or population dynamics that warrants further investigation. Overall, the data paints a picture of uneven economic development, where affluent municipalities continue to outpace their less prosperous counterparts, raising important questions about regional equity and long-term socioeconomic balance.

These visualizations underscore the income inequality across Danish municipalities, offering a foundation for analyzing how education and crime rates may be influencing these disparities.





##  Growth in Men’s Disposable Income (2007–2023): Top 10 Regions
___
The bar chart titled "Top 10 Regions by Growth in Men Disposable Income (2007–2023)" illustrates the increase in disposable income for men across ten regions in Denmark over a 16-year period.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/524a5f3d-486f-43af-915f-77cd3930f62b)



####  Key Insights

- **Billund** tops the list with the most significant growth — men’s disposable income increased by more than 360,000 DKK, far exceeding other regions.
- **Gentofte** and **Rudersdal** follow in second and third place, with income growth of approximately 310,000 DKK** and 270,000 DKK, respectively.
- Regions such as Dragør, Lyngby-Taarbæk, and Hørsholm experienced moderate growth, ranging between 160,000 to 180,000 DKK.
- Frederiksberg, Furesø, Allerød, and Rebild had the lowest growth among the top 10, each registering increases around 140,000 to 150,000 DKK.

The dramatic lead by **Billund** may reflect localized economic developments — such as investments, industry presence, or demographic shifts — that disproportionately benefited men’s earnings. More modest growth in regions like Rebild and Allerød still indicates positive change but on a smaller scale. Overall, the chart suggests **growing economic disparities** between regions in terms of **male disposable income growth**.

The bar chart titled **"Top 10 Regions by % Income Growth (2007–2023)"** shows the percentage increase in disposable income over time, allowing for a normalized comparison across regions regardless of starting income levels. The X-axis lists the top-performing regions, while the Y-axis represents the percentage growth in disposable income from 2007 to 2023.

####  Key Highlights

- **Billund** stands out dramatically, with a percentage growth exceeding 180%, far surpassing all other regions. This suggests an extraordinary economic development or income surge** over the period.
- **Gentofte** and **Rudersdal** follow with strong but significantly lower growth rates, around 80% and 75%, respectively.
- Regions such as Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Rebild, and Dragør all experienced fairly similar percentage increases, clustered between 68% and 72%.
- The lower end of the top 10 includes Lyngby-Taarbæk, Samsø, and Lemvig, each with growth rates just under 65%.
  
This percentage-based perspective emphasizes not just the absolute income gains but the relative improvement in disposable income for each region Billund again dominates, indicating it likely had both lower starting income levels and significant growth, making it an economic outlier in terms of development. The consistency in growth among the other regions suggests **widespread but uneven economic progress** across Denmark.
