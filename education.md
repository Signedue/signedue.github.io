# 🎓 Education in Denmark: Who's Learning, and Where?

Education is one of the pillars of Denmark's welfare state, a gateway to equal opportunity and personal growth. But while formal education is broadly accessible, not all groups or regions benefit equally.

In this page, we explore **15 years of education data** (2008–2023) from across Denmark. The database that was used in this analysis is from Statistics Denmark - https://www.dst.dk/en which was saved as "Database" and after that it was divided to two different datasets per sex ("Men" & "Women"). The primary goals of this analyis is to understand:
- 👩‍🎓 How gender trends have shifted in education
- 🗺️ Which regions are leading — and lagging — in educational attainment
- 📚 What types of education are growing, and which are being left behind

## Denmark, A Nation Getting Smarter (2008–2023)

Over the past decade and a half, Denmark has become **consistently more educated**. Across all regions and fields, the number of people completing formal education has grown year after year.

Below, you can see the national trend from 2008 to 2023:

![Total Educated People in Denmark](Total%20Educated%20People%20In%20Denmark%20(2008%20-%202023).png)

The line chart shows a steady increase in the number of educated people in Denmark from 2008 to 2023. Despite global disruptions like the 2008 financial crisis or the COVID-19 pandemic, education continued to expand, especially after 2019.

We observe:

- A gradual rise between 2008 and 2015

- A sharper acceleration after 2020, possibly reflecting a societal shift toward upskilling or reskilling in response to labor market changes

- No major dips, which highlights the resilience of Denmark’s education system

This confirms that Denmark is becoming a more educated society overall — but this alone doesn’t reveal who is driving the growth, or where it’s happening.

## 👩‍🎓 Gender Dynamics in Education: Women Take the Lead

While national education levels are rising, an even more important shift is happening within: **women are increasingly leading this growth**.

To explore this shift, we look at Copenhagen — Denmark’s largest and most urbanized region. It serves as a strong case study for national trends, especially in education, employment, and social mobility.

![Copenhagen Education Count](Copenhagen%20Education%20Count%20Over%20Time%20%20-%20%25%20of%20Educated%20Women.png)

In 2008, men outnumbered women in Copenhagen's educated population. But by 2013, the lines crossed — and since then, **women have consistently maintained the lead**.

The right-hand plot shows that women now make up over **50.5%** of all educated individuals in Copenhagen. This may seem like a small shift, but it marks a **fundamental reversal** in historical education dynamics.

> The gender gap in education hasn’t just closed — it’s reversed. And this change began in urban centers like Copenhagen.

## 📍 Where You Live Matters: The Urban Education Advantage

Copenhagen’s gender shift is part of a broader story — one that’s **regional as much as it is social**. If education is rising in Denmark, **where exactly is it rising fastest?**

To answer that, we visualized the **10 most educated regions in Denmark in 2023** using an interactive bubble map. The size of each bubble reflects the total number of educated individuals in that municipality.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Top 10 Educated Regions.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Copenhagen is the clear front-runner — its bubble dominates the map, with more than **500,000 educated individuals**, nearly **double that of Aarhus**, the second most educated city.

Urban centers like Odense, Aalborg, and Frederiksberg follow, reinforcing a familiar pattern: **education tends to concentrate in cities**.

Interestingly, smaller municipalities like **Silkeborg and Horsens** also make the top 10, suggesting that **not all educational growth is confined to the largest metros**. These outliers hint at regional strategies or institutions driving local educational success.

> Geography plays a powerful role in shaping opportunity. The map makes one thing clear: **Denmark’s educational success is not shared equally — and the gap is spatial as well as social**.

## 🌍 The Other Side of the Map: Underserved Regions

While our previous map showed where education is thriving, it’s equally important to highlight where it's lacking. **Inequality in education is geographic** — and stark.

The bubble map below shows the **10 least educated regions** in Denmark, based on the number of educated people in 2023.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Bottom 10 Least Educated Regions.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

These regions are mostly **small islands and rural municipalities**, like Christiansø, Læsø, Fanø, and Samsø. With populations often under 5,000, their absolute education numbers are naturally lower — but this still reflects **limited access to higher education institutions, fewer job market incentives, and perhaps migration of young talent to cities**.

Notably, even some **suburban or peri-urban** places like Dragør and Vallensbæk appear on this list — pointing to challenges beyond just isolation.

> The Danish education story is not one of equal opportunity. While urban areas accumulate resources and retain talent, rural areas — especially the smallest — risk being left further behind.

This disparity suggests the need for **targeted regional education policy**, investment in local institutions, and incentives to retain educated residents outside the major cities.

## 🎓 What Are People Studying?

So far, we’ve seen **where** people are getting educated. But what about **what** they’re studying?

Understanding which types of education dominate in each region can offer insight into **regional economies, labor market demands, and institutional specializations**.

To explore this, we break down the top 5 most educated regions by **education type** in 2023.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Distribution of Education Types Across Top 5 regions.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Higher education dominates across all top regions. Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees are leading. Odense and Silkeborg show relatively stronger engagement in vocational education.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Evolution of Education Types Over Time.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Academic degrees are rising sharply. Vocational and trade-oriented programs show slower or negative growth. The country is becoming more educated — but also more academically skewed.

# 👩‍💼 Gendered Preferences

Now we compare educational preferences between men and women.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Gender Distribution by Education Type.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Women dominate in education and health. Men are more concentrated in engineering and trades. Some categories, like Bachelor’s degrees, are more balanced.

Education is accessible to all — but still culturally gendered.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="% Growth in Education Type by Gender.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Growth tells the same story: women are outpacing men in most categories, especially in academic fields. Men show smaller gains in vocational sectors.

# 🏆 What’s Most (and Least) Popular?

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="top5_education_types_men_women.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

The most common paths reflect the gendered split we’ve seen: vocational and technical education for men, social and health sciences for women.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="bottom5_education_types_men_women.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Men rarely pursue nursing or primary school teaching. Women are least represented in engineering and certain trade programs. These gaps have persisted for over a decade.

# 🔮 Forecasting the Future (ML Model)

Finally, we use linear regression to predict education trends in Copenhagen through 2030. The model is trained separately for men and women.

![Education Forecast in Copenhagen](Education%20Predict.png)

Women are projected to maintain and even widen their lead in educational attainment. Men continue to grow more slowly. The model confirms: if current trends hold, gender imbalance in favor of women will deepen.

Machine learning shows us the future: more education overall, but widening gender gaps.

# 🧐 Final Reflection

Denmark is becoming more educated. That’s the good news.

But the data also reveals inequalities:

Urban centers thrive. Rural areas lag.

Women lead growth. Men are slowing down.

Academic education expands. Vocational paths shrink.

Education policy in Denmark must now move beyond access. It must focus on regional inclusion, gender balance, and program diversity.

Only then will education truly be the equalizer it was meant to be.
