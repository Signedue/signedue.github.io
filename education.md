# Education in Denmark: Who's Learning, and Where?

In this page, we explore **15 years of education data** (2008–2023) from across Denmark. The database that was used in this analysis is from Statistics Denmark - https://www.dst.dk/en which was saved as "Database" and after that I created two new datasets per sex ("Men" & "Women"). The primary goals of this analyis is to understand:
We focus on three main questions:
- How have gender dynamics shifted in education?
- Which regions are growing or lagging behind?
- What kinds of education programs are most or least popular?

## Denmark, A Nation Getting Smarter (2008–2023)

Over the past decade and a half, Denmark has become **consistently more educated**. Across all regions and fields, the number of people completing formal education has grown year after year.

Below, you can see the national trend from 2008 to 2023:

![Total Educated People in Denmark](Total%20Educated%20People%20In%20Denmark%20(2008%20-%202023).png)

The line chart shows a steady increase in the number of educated people in Denmark from 2008 to 2023. Despite global disruptions like the 2008 financial crisis or the COVID-19 pandemic, education continued to expand, especially after 2019.

We observe:

- A gradual rise between 2008 and 2015

- A sharper acceleration after 2020, possibly reflecting a societal shift toward upskilling or reskilling in response to labor market changes

- No major dips, which highlights the resilience of Denmark’s education system

This confirms that Denmark is becoming a more educated society overall — but this alone doesn’t reveal who is driving the growth, or where it’s happening.

## Gender Dynamics in Education: Women Take the Lead

While national education levels are rising, an even more important shift is happening within: **women are increasingly leading this growth**.

To explore this shift, we look at Copenhagen — Denmark’s largest and most urbanized region. It serves as a strong case study for national trends, especially in education, employment, and social mobility.

![Copenhagen Education Count](Copenhagen%20Education%20Count%20Over%20Time%20%20-%20%25%20of%20Educated%20Women.png)

In 2008, men outnumbered women in Copenhagen's educated population. But by 2013, the lines crossed — and since then, **women have consistently maintained the lead**.

The right-hand plot shows that women now make up over **50.5%** of all educated individuals in Copenhagen. This may seem like a small shift, but it marks a **fundamental reversal** in historical education dynamics.

## Where You Live Matters: The Urban Education Advantage

Copenhagen’s gender shift is part of a broader story — one that’s **regional as much as it is social**. If education is rising in Denmark, **where exactly is it rising fastest?**

To answer that, we visualized the **10 most educated regions in Denmark in 2023** using an interactive bubble map. The size of each bubble reflects the total number of educated individuals in that municipality.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Top 10 Educated Regions.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Copenhagen is the clear front-runner — its bubble dominates the map, with more than **500,000 educated individuals**, nearly **double that of Aarhus**, the second most educated city.

Urban centers like Odense, Aalborg, and Frederiksberg follow, reinforcing a familiar pattern: **education tends to concentrate in cities**.

Interestingly, smaller municipalities like **Silkeborg and Horsens** also make the top 10, suggesting that **not all educational growth is confined to the largest metros**. These outliers hint at regional strategies or institutions driving local educational success.

## The Other Side of the Map: Underserved Regions

While our previous map showed where education is thriving, it’s equally important to highlight where it's lacking. **Inequality in education is geographic** — and stark.

The bubble map below shows the **10 least educated regions** in Denmark, based on the number of educated people in 2023.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Bottom 10 Least Educated Regions.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

These regions are mostly **small islands and rural municipalities**, like Christiansø, Læsø, Fanø, and Samsø. With populations often under 5,000, their absolute education numbers are naturally lower — but this still reflects **limited access to higher education institutions, fewer job market incentives, and perhaps migration of young talent to cities**.

Notably, even some **suburban or peri-urban** places like Dragør and Vallensbæk appear on this list — pointing to challenges beyond just isolation.

This disparity suggests the need for **targeted regional education policy**, investment in local institutions, and incentives to retain educated residents outside the major cities.

## What Are People Studying?

So far, we’ve seen **where** people are getting educated. But what about **what** they’re studying?

Understanding which types of education dominate in each region can offer insight into **regional economies, labor market demands, and institutional specializations**.

To explore this, we break down the top 5 most educated regions by **education type** in 2023.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Distribution of Education Types Across Top 5 regions.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Across all five regions — Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Aalborg, and Frederiksberg — **Bachelor’s and Master’s programs dominate**, highlighting the urban concentration of higher education institutions.

However, variation exists:

- **Odense** shows a stronger presence of **Vocational Education and Training (VET)**, likely due to its historical industry links.
- **Aarhus** and **Copenhagen** stand out for **PhD and advanced academic programs**, reflecting the location of major universities.
- **Frederiksberg**, despite its size, shows high engagement in **social sciences and health programs**, which aligns with local institutional focus areas.

Next, we’ll explore how education types have evolved over time — and whether some programs are expanding while others fade away.


## How Education Types Have Evolved Over Time

After comparing what regions prioritize, we now zoom out to look at **national trends in education types** from 2008 to 2023.

Each line in the chart below represents a different type of education — from primary schooling to PhDs — and shows how participation in each has changed over the past 15 years.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Evolution of Education Types Over Time.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

- **Bachelor’s and Master’s programs** show the most consistent growth, reflecting Denmark’s shift toward a highly educated workforce.
- **Primary education and youth education programs** remain stable or decline slightly — likely because these levels are more population-based and less influenced by policy or economic trends.
- **PhD programs** have grown modestly, but remain small in absolute numbers.
- Some **vocational and trade programs** appear to plateau, especially in the years following 2015 — suggesting either saturation or a societal pivot away from manual professions.

> The data paints a picture of a society increasingly focused on **academic and professional education**, with a gradual shift away from traditional vocational pathways.

Next, we explore how these shifts differ **by gender** — and whether women are driving particular types of education more than men.

##  Gender Differences Across Education Types

We've seen how education programs have evolved over time — but who is filling those seats?

The chart below breaks down **male and female participation** across all education types in 2023. It offers a clear snapshot of **gendered educational preferences** and highlights persistent divides between fields.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Gender Distribution by Education Type.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

- **Health and education programs** are overwhelmingly female-dominated — reflecting societal norms and career clustering still present in Denmark.
- **Technical and vocational education**, including trade and engineering pathways, remain male-heavy.
- **Bachelor’s and Master’s programs** are more balanced, but even here women slightly outnumber men in most fields.
- The biggest surprise? **PhD programs**, long male-dominated, are approaching parity — a promising sign of change in academia.

Next, we’ll explore how some of these categories have **grown or declined over time** — and whether the gender split is changing with them.

##  Who's Driving Growth in Education?

We’ve seen the gender split in 2023 — but how did we get here?

This chart compares the **percentage growth** in each type of education from 2008 to 2023, separated by gender. It shows not just where men and women are today, but **how fast each group is growing across different educational pathways**.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Growth in Education Type by Gender.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

- **Women lead growth in nearly all academic education categories**, including Bachelor’s, Master’s, and professional programs.
- Men show stronger growth in **vocational and trade-oriented programs**, although these categories are expanding more modestly overall.
- Some types of education — like **short-cycle tertiary or certain youth education tracks** — show negative or flat growth, especially among men.
- The gap in growth rate is most striking in higher education, where **women consistently outpace men by 30–50%** in relative terms.

## The Most Popular Education Types for Each Gender

After comparing how education types have grown differently for men and women, we now take a closer look at **which specific programs dominate** for each gender — and how participation in them has changed over time.

The plots below highlight the **Top 5 education types** for men and women respectively, showing yearly trends from 2008 to 2023.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="top5_education_types_men_women.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

- **Men** tend to dominate in areas like **vocational education**, **engineering**, and **short-cycle technical programs** — paths often aligned with hands-on professions and technical fields.
- **Women** lead strongly in **health**, **education**, and **social sciences** — with growing participation across all five categories.
- For both sexes, the lines rise gradually, indicating consistent long-term growth — but **women’s lines rise more steeply**, echoing earlier observations about their leading role in education expansion.

## The Other Side of the Spectrum: Bottom 5 Education Types

Just as some fields are surging, others are quietly falling behind.

To complete the picture, we examine the **bottom 5 education types** for men and women respectively — the least pursued programs over the 15-year span from 2008 to 2023.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="bottom5_education_types_men_women.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

- For **men**, the least pursued programs include **arts**, **nursing**, and **teaching** — traditionally female-dominated fields.
- For **women**, technical tracks such as **engineering**, **trade-oriented programs**, and **short-cycle technical education** appear at the bottom.
- Both charts show **flat or slow growth**, signaling persistent gender biases and limited efforts to diversify enrollment in these areas.

These less popular programs aren’t necessarily less important — but they remain **culturally and economically gendered**, attracting far less participation despite nationwide progress in education access.

## What Comes Next? Forecasting Education in Copenhagen

To complete our analysis, we used a simple linear regression model to **predict education trends in Copenhagen through 2030** — separately for men and women.

![Education Forecast in Copenhagen](Education%20Predict.png)

- Both men and women are projected to continue growing their educational participation at a steady rate.
- **Women maintain a consistent lead**, reinforcing the reversal we observed earlier: the gender gap hasn’t just closed — it has flipped.
- The gap **slightly widens** by 2030, suggesting that unless intervention happens, **male participation may lag** further behind over time.

## Final Reflection

This journey through Denmark’s education landscape has revealed a society that’s **growing smarter**, but not always **more equal**.

- Education is rising overall — especially in urban areas like Copenhagen
- Women now lead across most levels and types of education
- Vocational and trade tracks are declining, especially among women
- Geography, gender, and program type all shape who gets educated — and how

This final forecast reminds us that the trends we see today will shape the workforce, inequality, and opportunity in years to come.
