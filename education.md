# 🎓 Education in Denmark: Who's Learning, and Where?

Education has long been a cornerstone of Danish society. As one of the most equitable welfare states in the world, Denmark prides itself on accessible, high-quality education. But who exactly is benefitting? Where is this education concentrated? And how is it evolving across gender and geography?

This page explores 15 years of education data (2008–2023) in Denmark, diving into:

👩‍🏫 How gender participation has changed

🌍 Where education is growing (or declining)

💡 What kinds of education are thriving

🌍 A Nation Getting Smarter

We begin by looking at the total number of educated individuals in Denmark across all education types. The trend is clear: Denmark is becoming more educated, year after year.

(![Total Educated People in Denmark](Total%20Educated%20People%20In%20Denmark%20(2008%20-%202023).png))

We observe a steady national increase, even during global crises like the financial crash and the COVID-19 pandemic. Education in Denmark has proven remarkably resilient.

# 👩‍🏫 Gender Reversal: Women Take the Lead

Let’s zoom into Copenhagen, where education trends often begin. In 2008, men led in educational attainment. But by 2013, the lines crossed.

![Copenhagen Education Count](Copenhagen%20Education%20Count%20Over%20Time%20%20-%20%25%20of%20Educated%20Women.png)

Since then, women have maintained their lead. As of 2023, over 50.5% of the educated population in Copenhagen are women. A historic reversal.

The gender gap hasn’t just closed — it’s flipped. And the shift began in the capital.

# 🌍 Where You Live Matters

To see how this shift plays out nationwide, we mapped the regions with the highest and lowest education totals.

</div>

Urban centers dominate: Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, and Aalborg top the list. Smaller regions like Frederiksberg and Silkeborg punch above their weight.

</div>

The least educated areas are largely small islands and rural municipalities — places like Christiansø, Læsø, and Fanø. These areas show not just lower numbers, but stagnant or declining growth.

Geography plays a powerful role in opportunity. Urban areas rise. Rural ones risk falling behind.

# 🎓 What Are People Studying?

Next, we ask: what types of education are people pursuing?

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Distribution of Education Types Across Top 5 regions.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Higher education dominates across all top regions. Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees are leading. Odense and Silkeborg show relatively stronger engagement in vocational education.

  <iframe src="Evolution of Education Types Over Time.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Academic degrees are rising sharply. Vocational and trade-oriented programs show slower or negative growth. The country is becoming more educated — but also more academically skewed.

# 👩‍💼 Gendered Preferences

Now we compare educational preferences between men and women.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="Gender Distribution by Education Type.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Women dominate in education and health. Men are more concentrated in engineering and trades. Some categories, like Bachelor’s degrees, are more balanced.

Education is accessible to all — but still culturally gendered.

  <iframe src="% Growth in Education Type by Gender.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Growth tells the same story: women are outpacing men in most categories, especially in academic fields. Men show smaller gains in vocational sectors.

# 🏆 What’s Most (and Least) Popular?

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="top5_education_types_men_women.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

The most common paths reflect the gendered split we’ve seen: vocational and technical education for men, social and health sciences for women.

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <iframe src="bottom5_education_types_men_women.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"></iframe>
</div>

Men rarely pursue nursing or primary school teaching. Women are least represented in engineering and certain trade programs. These gaps have persisted for over a decade.

# 🔮 Forecasting the Future (ML Model)

Finally, we use linear regression to predict education trends in Copenhagen through 2030. The model is trained separately for men and women.

Women are projected to maintain and even widen their lead in educational attainment. Men continue to grow more slowly. The model confirms: if current trends hold, gender imbalance in favor of women will deepen.

Machine learning shows us the future: more education overall, but widening gender gaps.

# 🧐 Final Reflection

Denmark is becoming more educated. That’s the good news.

But the data also reveals inequalities:

Urban centers thrive. Rural areas lag.

Women lead growth. Men are slowing down.

Academic education expands. Vocational paths shrink.

Education policy in Denmark must now move beyond access. It must focus on regional inclusion, gender balance, and program diversity.

Only then will education truly be the equalizer it was meant to be.
